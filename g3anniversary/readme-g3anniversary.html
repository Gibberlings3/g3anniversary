<p>The Gibberlings Three was founded on September 18, 2003 as the Delainy   Forum. Over the years, the site, projects, and visitors coming to <acronym title="The Gibberlings Three">G3</acronym> have grown immensely, and we've had a lot of fun building a community   with you. This mod was a collaborative effort of a lot of the resident <acronym title="The Gibberlings Three">G3</acronym> modders and marks not only a celebration of the past years but our gratitude to you for helping make <acronym title="The Gibberlings Three">G3</acronym> what it is today. </p>

<p>This mod is designed to work with <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2: Enhanced Edition, the original BG2</acronym>:   Shadows of Amn (with or without the expansion pack Throne of Bhaal) and the conversion projects BGT and EET.   There are no known or suspected problems with compatibility. Due to some   area and worldmap patching, you will need to start a new game to get   the full experience of the mod. While this mod does alter the worldmap,   it does so interactively and should be fully compatible with other mods,   though it should be installed after mods which alter the worldmap. </p>

      <p><strong>Enhanced Editions Note</strong><br />
        The Enhanced Editions are actively supported games. Please note that every   patch update will wipe your current mod setup! If in the middle of a   modded game you might want to delay the patch update (if possible) as   even after reinstalling the mods, you might not be able to continue with   your old savegames. Alternatively, copy the whole game's folder into a   new one that can be modded and will stay untouched by game patches. For BG2:EE it is important that you install the mod to the language   version you are playing the game in. Otherwise, the dialogues of the mod   will not show but give error messages. </p>
      <p><strong>Windows</strong><br />
        The Gibberlings Three Anniversary Mod for Windows is distributed as a self-extracting   archive and includes a WeiDU installer. To install, simply double-click   the archive and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, the files can be extracted into your game directory using <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7zip</a> or <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm">WinRAR</a>. When properly extracted, your game directory will contain <strong>setup-g3anniversary.exe</strong> and the folder<strong> g3anniversary</strong>. To install, double-click <strong>setup-g3anniversary.exe</strong> and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
      <p>You can run <strong>setup-g3anniversary.exe</strong> in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.</p>
      <p><strong>Mac OS X</strong><br />
        The Gibberlings Three Anniversary Mod  for Mac OS X is distributed as a compressed tarball and includes a WeiDU installer.</p>
      <p>First, extract the files from the tarball into your game directory. When properly extracted, your game directory will contain <strong>setup-g3anniversary</strong>, <strong>setup-g3anniversary.command</strong>, and the folder<strong> g3anniversary</strong>. To install, double-click <strong>setup-g3anniversary.command</strong> and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
      <p>You can run <strong>setup-g3anniversary.command</strong> in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.</p>
      <p><strong>Linux</strong><br />
        The Gibberlings Three Anniversary Mod  for Linux is distributed as a compressed tarball and does not include a WeiDU installer.</p>
      <p>Extract the contents of the mod to the folder of the game you wish to modify.</p>
      <p>Download the latest version of WeiDU for Linux from <a href="http://www.weidu.org/%7Ethebigg/">WeiDU.org</a> and copy WeiDU and WeInstall to /usr/bin. Following that, open a terminal, cd to your game installation directory, run tolower   and answer Y to both queries. You can avoid running the second option   (linux.ini) if you've already ran it once in the same directory. To save   time, the archive is already tolowered, so there's no need to run the   first option (lowercasing file names) either if you've extracted only   this mod since the last time you lowercased file names. If you're   unsure, running tolower and choosing both options is the safe bet.</p>
      <p>To install, run WeInstall g3anniversary in your game folder. Then run wine BGMain.exe and start playing. </p>
      <p><strong> Note for Complete Uninstallation</strong><br />
        In addition to the methods above for removing individual components, you can completely uninstall the mod using setup-g3anniversary --uninstall at the command line to remove all components without wading through prompts. . </p>

<p>When we decided to put together an anniversary mod, we felt we should do   something that would be, above all, fun to make and fun to play. Hence,   as a starting point we settled on a semi-serious running joke of Grim   Squeaker's that we should do a quest mod involving a pub crawl. To   initiate the quest, go look for Drini in the Copper Coronet. Expect some   fourth-wall breakage and some outright silliness, and keep your eyes   open--you may even spot someone you know.</p>

<p>The modding community for the Infinity Engine has been going strong for
        more than 10 years now, and is the culmination of thousands of unpaid modding
        hours by fellow fans of the game. Modders produce their best work and players
      get the best, well-supported mods when we all work together. </p>
<p> There are two big ways to upset this harmony. One is to claim someone else's
  work as your own. The second is to host and redistribute a mod without permission
  from the author(s). </p>
<p> Be kind to your fellow players and modders. Don't do either. </p>
