<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>The Gibberlings Three was founded on September 18, 2003 as the Delainy Forum. Over the years, the site, projects, and visitors coming to <acronym title="The Gibberlings Three">G3</acronym> have grown immensely, and we've had a lot of fun building a community with you. This mod was a collaborative effort of a lot of the resident <acronym title="The Gibberlings Three">G3</acronym> modders and marks not only a celebration of the past years but our gratitude to you for helping make <acronym title="The Gibberlings Three">G3</acronym> what it is today. </p>
  <p>For bug reports and suggestions please visit the <a href="http://forums.gibberlings3.net/">Gibberlings Three forums</a>. </p>
</div>

<h2>Compatibility</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>This mod is designed to work with <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym>: Shadows of Amn, with or without the expansion pack Throne of Bhaal. There are no known or suspected problems with compatibility. Due to some area and worldmap patching, you will need to start a new game to get the full experience of the mod. While this mod does alter the worldmap, it does so interactively and should be fully compatible with other mods, though it should be installed after mods which alter the worldmap. </p>
</div>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p><strong>Windows</strong><br />
    The <acronym title="The Gibberlings Three">G3</acronym> Anniversary Mod is packaged and installed with <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> and is distributed as a self-extracting archive. To install, simply double-click the archive and follow the instructions on screen.</p>

  <p>Alternatively the files can be extracted from the archive using <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/">WinRAR</a>. If properly extracted, you should have a G3Anniversary folder and Setup-G3Anniversary.exe in your <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> folder. To install, simply double-click Setup-G3Anniversary.exe and follow the instructions on screen.</p>

  <p> Please run Setup-G3Anniversary.exe in your <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components. </p>

  <p><strong>Mac OS X</strong><br />
    <em>If the mod was previously installed, uninstall it before extracting the
    new version. </em>The <acronym title="The Gibberlings Three">G3</acronym> Anniversary mod is packaged and installed with <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym>. To install, simply extract the contents of the mod into your <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> folder. If properly extracted, you should have a G3Anniversary folder, Setup-G3Anniversary, and Setup-G3Anniversary.command in your <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> folder. To install, simply double-click <strong>Setup-G3Anniversary.command</strong> and follow the instructions on screen.</p>

  <p><strong>Linux</strong><br />
    Extract the contents of the mod to the folder of the game you wish to modify. Download the latest version of <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utilities">WeiDU</acronym> for Linux from <a href="http://www.weidu.org/users/thebigg/">WeiDU.org</a> and copy WeiDU, WeInstall and tolower to somewhere in your path (/usr/local/bin/ or /usr/bin/ , for example). Following that, open a terminal, cd to your game installation directory, run 'tolower' and answer Y to both queries.</p>

  <p>You can avoid running the second option (linux.ini) if you've already run it once in the same directory. To save time, the archive is already tolowered, so there's no need to run the first option (lowercasing file names) either if you've extracted only this mod since the last time you lowercased filenames. If you're unsure, running tolower and choosing both options is the safe bet.</p>
  
  <p>Make sure you have oggdec installed. Chances are good your linux distribution will have it included in a package called vorbis-tools. Run <strong>oggdec -V</strong> in a terminal if you want to be sure you have it.</p>

  <p>Run <strong>WeInstall g3anniversary</strong> in your game folder to install the mod. Then run <strong>wine bgmain.exe</strong> and start playing.</p>

<h2>Contents</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p> When we decided to put together an anniversary mod, we felt we should do something that would be, above all, fun to make and fun to play. Hence, as a starting point we settled on a semi-serious running joke of Grim Squeaker's that we should do a quest mod involving a pub crawl. To initiate the quest, go look for Drini in the Copper Coronet. Expect some fourth-wall breakage and some outright silliness, and keep your eyes open--you may even spot someone you know.</p>
