# The Gibberlings Three Anniversary Mod

## Overview

The Gibberlings Three was founded on September 18, 2003 as the Delainy Forum. Over the years, the site, projects, and visitors coming to G3 have grown immensely, and we've had a lot of fun building a community with you. This mod was a collaborative effort of a lot of the resident G3 modders and marks not only a celebration of the past years but our gratitude to you for helping make G3 what it is today.
